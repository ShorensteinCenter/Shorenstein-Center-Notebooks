# Shorenstein-Center-Notebooks
Two jupyter notebooks written in python. Example code for using data science tools to analyze your audience.

This repository contains the Shorenstein Center Notebooks, two [jupyter notebooks]( http://jupyter.org/) published by [the Shorenstein Center]( https://shorensteincenter.org/). The notebooks were written and tested in Python 2.7, but will be updated to Python 3.6 in the coming months. To interpret your results, please visit the accompanying [research guide](http://###). Contributions to the notebooks are welcome.

NOTE: Although we try to provide as much guidance as possible for you to run the notebooks yourself without assistance, running the notebooks are technical in nature. We acknowledge there is a learning curve to getting set up and running the notebooks. For further assistance feel free to contact Jacque@kingrailconsulting.com

## Prerequisites
1.[Download Anaconda]( https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos). If you are a novice or new to coding there is a brief beginners tutorial [here](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/541429b0748bc916daa431f9d/files/a957cfd4-bee4-43b5-a631-7231380db477/python_simple.pdf).

2.Install a python wrapper for your email service provider API if available. In the Shorenstein Notebooks we use the [mailchimp3]( https://github.com/charlesthk/python-mailchimp) wrapper. Search the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)) and GitHub to find relevant packages and check when they were last updated.

## Running the notebooks
If you are not familiar with jupyter notebooks, read this [quick start guide]( https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
